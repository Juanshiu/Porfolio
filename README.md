## 🛠️ Stack

- [**Astro**](https://astro.build/) - The web framework for content-driven websites.
- [**Typescript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JavaScript with syntax for types.
- [**Tailwindcss**](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- [**Animate.css**](https://animate.style/) - Is a library of ready-to-use, cross-browser animations for use in your web projects.
- [**fontsource**](https://fontsource.org/) - Self-host Open Source fonts in neatly bundled NPM packages.

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
